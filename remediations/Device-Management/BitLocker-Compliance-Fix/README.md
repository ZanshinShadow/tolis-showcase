# BitLocker Drive Encryption Compliance Fix

A comprehensive **enterprise-grade BitLocker remediation solution** designed to automatically detect, remediate, and maintain encryption compliance across managed Windows devices in corporate environments.

## üîê Security Value Proposition

This remediation solution addresses **critical data protection compliance requirements**:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS encryption-at-rest mandates
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Hardware-backed encryption with TPM 2.0 integration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents data breaches from stolen or lost devices
- **Audit Readiness**: Comprehensive logging and compliance reporting
- **Enterprise Scale**: Automated remediation across thousands of managed endpoints

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Critical BitLocker Issues This Solution Addresses

| Security Issue | Business Risk | Regulatory Impact |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Unencrypted Devices** | Data breach exposure | GDPR fines up to ‚Ç¨20M |
| **Failed Key Escrow** | Unable to recover encrypted data | Business continuity failure |
| **TPM Misconfiguration** | Weak encryption implementation | Compliance audit failure |
| **Expired Certificates** | Encryption service disruption | Operational downtime |
| **Policy Drift** | Inconsistent security posture | Regulatory non-compliance |

### Target Compliance Scenarios
- Devices with BitLocker disabled or partially encrypted
- Recovery keys not properly escrowed to Azure AD or MBAM
- TPM hardware not initialized or configured for BitLocker
- Encryption methods not meeting organizational security standards
- Auto-unlock configuration missing for secondary drives

## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Detection Logic (`DetectionScript.ps1`)

```powershell
# Enterprise Security Validation
‚úì TPM Hardware Status           # TPM 2.0 presence, readiness, ownership
‚úì Encryption Status             # Full encryption, protection active
‚úì Key Escrow Validation        # Azure AD/MBAM backup verification
‚úì Encryption Method Compliance # AES-256/XTS-AES-256 standards
‚úì Auto-Unlock Configuration    # Secondary drive access
‚úì System Health Assessment     # Services, WMI, event logs
```

**Compliance Criteria:**
- **Compliant (Exit 0)**: All security requirements met, audit-ready
- **Non-Compliant (Exit 1)**: Critical security gaps requiring immediate remediation

### Remediation Actions (`RemediationScript.ps1`)

```powershell
# Comprehensive Security Remediation
1. TPM Initialization          # Hardware security module preparation
2. BitLocker Enablement        # Drive encryption with enterprise settings
3. Recovery Key Backup         # Azure AD/MBAM escrow with verification
4. Encryption Method Update    # Security standard compliance
5. Auto-Unlock Configuration   # Seamless user experience
6. Configuration Repair        # Service restoration and cache cleanup
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

### Common Deployment Challenges

#### Issue: TPM Not Ready for BitLocker
```powershell
# Symptoms: TPM present but not initialized
# Diagnostic Commands:
Get-Tpm | Select-Object TmpPresent, TmpReady, TmpEnabled, TmpOwned
Get-WmiObject -Namespace "Root\CIMV2\Security\MicrosoftTpm" -Class "Win32_Tpm"

# Resolution: BIOS/UEFI TPM Settings
# 1. Enable TPM in BIOS/UEFI firmware
# 2. Clear TPM if previously configured incorrectly  
# 3. Allow TPM ownership change in enterprise environment
```

#### Issue: BitLocker Encryption Fails
```powershell
# Symptoms: Enable-BitLocker cmdlet fails with access denied
# Diagnostic Commands:
Get-BitLockerVolume -MountPoint $env:SystemDrive
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; ProviderName='Microsoft-Windows-BitLocker*'; Level=2}

# Resolution: Prerequisites Validation
# 1. Verify administrative privileges
# 2. Check disk space (at least 1.5GB free)
# 3. Validate TPM ownership and key protector compatibility
# 4. Ensure no conflicting encryption software
```

#### Issue: Recovery Key Backup Failures
```powershell
# Symptoms: BackupToAAD-BitLockerKeyProtector fails
# Diagnostic Commands:
dsregcmd /status  # Check Azure AD join status
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-AAD/Operational'; Level=2}

# Resolution: Azure AD Connectivity
# 1. Verify device Azure AD registration
# 2. Check network connectivity to Azure endpoints
# 3. Validate device compliance policies
# 4. Force Azure AD registration renewal if needed
```

### Advanced Diagnostic Scripts

#### BitLocker Health Validation
```powershell
# Comprehensive BitLocker Diagnostic Report
function Get-BitLockerHealthReport {
    $Report = @{
        DeviceName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
        TPMStatus = Get-Tpm | Select-Object TmpPresent, TmpReady, TmpEnabled
        EncryptionStatus = Get-BitLockerVolume | Select-Object MountPoint, VolumeStatus, ProtectionStatus, EncryptionPercentage
        RecentErrors = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; ProviderName='Microsoft-Windows-BitLocker*'; Level=2; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-7)} | Select-Object -First 5
        AzureADStatus = & dsregcmd /status
    }
    return $Report | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
}
```
