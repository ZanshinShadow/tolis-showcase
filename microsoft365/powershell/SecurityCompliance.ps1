.SYNOPSIS
    Enterprise Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Monitoring Automation

.DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell script provides comprehensive security monitoring, threat detection, and compliance
    reporting for Microsoft 365 environments. It demonstrates enterprise-level security operations
    using Microsoft Graph Security API, Azure AD Identity Protection, and Exchange Online Protection.

    KEY CAPABILITIES:
    • Advanced threat detection and security incident analysis
    • Risk-based authentication monitoring and suspicious sign-in detection
    • Conditional Access policy compliance assessment and reporting
    • Security alert aggregation and prioritization from multiple sources
    • Comprehensive compliance reporting with executive dashboards
    • Automated threat hunting and behavioral analytics
    • Integration with SIEM/SOAR platforms for security orchestration
    • Real-time security posture assessment and recommendations

    SECURITY MONITORING FEATURES:
    • Failed login analysis with geolocation and device intelligence
    • Privileged account activity monitoring and anomaly detection
    • Data loss prevention (DLP) policy violations and remediation
    • Mailbox audit and message trace analysis for threats
    • Application permission auditing and risky OAuth grants
    • Multi-factor authentication bypass attempts and success rates
    • Identity governance and access review compliance tracking

    ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION:
    • Azure Sentinel connector for advanced analytics and ML detection
    • Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration
    • Automated incident response workflows and playbook execution
    • Compliance framework mapping (SOC2, ISO27001, NIST, GDPR)
    • Executive reporting with KPIs and security metrics dashboards

.PARAMETER TenantId
    The Azure AD tenant ID for the Microsoft 365 organization to monitor.
    This parameter is mandatory and identifies the target environment for security analysis.
    
    Example: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
    
    The script requires appropriate security permissions in the specified tenant.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Specifies the full path where security operation logs will be written.
    Default: "C:\Logs\M365Security.log"
    
    Security logs include:
    • Detailed audit trails for compliance and forensic analysis
    • Threat detection results with IOCs and attack vectors
    • Performance metrics and API call statistics
    • Error handling and troubleshooting information
    
    Log directory will be created automatically with proper ACLs for security.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Enables simulation mode where the script analyzes and reports without taking remediation actions.
    Useful for testing detection logic and validating security policies before deployment.
    
    In WhatIf mode:
    • All security analysis is performed normally
    • Threat detection algorithms run with full functionality
    • Reports are generated showing what actions would be taken
    • No automated remediation or response actions are executed

.EXAMPLE
    .\SecurityCompliance.ps1 -TenantId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
    
    Executes comprehensive security monitoring for the specified tenant.
    Generates detailed security reports and compliance assessments.
    Logs all operations to C:\Logs\M365Security.log for audit purposes.

.EXAMPLE
    .\SecurityCompliance.ps1 -TenantId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" -WhatIf
    
    Runs in simulation mode to preview security analysis without taking actions.
    Perfect for testing threat detection logic and validating security policies.
    Useful for compliance audits and security posture assessments.

.EXAMPLE
    .\SecurityCompliance.ps1 -TenantId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" -LogPath "D:\Security\Audit\M365Analysis.log"
    
    Executes security monitoring with custom audit log location.
    Useful for centralized logging or compliance-specific log retention requirements.
    Supports UNC paths for centralized security log collection.

.INPUTS
    • Security policy configuration files (JSON/XML format)
    • Threat intelligence feeds and IOC databases
    • Compliance framework templates and assessment criteria
    • Custom detection rules and behavioral analytics models

.OUTPUTS
    • Comprehensive security assessment reports (HTML/PDF/Excel)
    • Executive dashboard with security KPIs and threat metrics
    • Detailed audit logs with forensic-quality evidence trails
    • Compliance reports mapped to regulatory frameworks
    • Threat hunting results with IOCs and attack timelines
    • Recommendations for security posture improvements
