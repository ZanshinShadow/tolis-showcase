- Secrets detection and prevention
```

### Infrastructure Security
```hcl
# Example: Network Security Group rules
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "deny_all_inbound" {
  name                       = "DenyAllInbound"
  priority                   = 4096
  direction                  = "Inbound"
  access                     = "Deny"
  protocol                   = "*"
  source_port_range          = "*"
  destination_port_range     = "*"
  source_address_prefix      = "*"
  destination_address_prefix = "*"
}
```
