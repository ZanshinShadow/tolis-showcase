# ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTICES

## üéØ Project Purpose

This repository is a **professional showcase project** designed to demonstrate expertise in:
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code
- Microsoft 365 Administration
- Azure Cloud Services
- DevSecOps Practices

**This is NOT a production-ready system** and should be used for **educational and demonstration purposes only**.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Disclaimer

### Liability Limitation
- **NO WARRANTY**: This project is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind
- **NO LIABILITY**: The author is not liable for any damages, costs, or issues arising from the use of this code
- **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Any deployment or modification is at your own responsibility

### Professional Showcase Notice
- This project demonstrates technical capabilities and best practices
- All examples are for educational and portfolio purposes
- Not intended for production use without proper review and testing

### Security Considerations
- **Review Before Use**: Always review and test code before deployment
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are current and secure
- **Environment Specific**: Configurations may need adaptation for your environment
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit real credentials or sensitive data

## üí∞ Cost Awareness

### Azure Resource Costs
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Deploying these Azure resources **WILL INCUR COSTS** on your Azure subscription:

- Virtual Machines (compute costs)
- Storage Accounts (storage and transaction costs)
- Load Balancers (hourly charges)
- SQL Database (compute and storage costs)
- Key Vault (per operation costs)
- Log Analytics (data ingestion costs)

### Cost Management Recommendations
1. **Use development environment** settings for testing
2. **Monitor costs** regularly through Azure Cost Management
3. **Clean up resources** when not needed: `terraform destroy`
4. **Set up budget alerts** to avoid unexpected charges
5. **Review pricing** before deployment: [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use Azure Key Vault** for production secrets
- **Rotate credentials** regularly
- **Follow least privilege** access principles

### Infrastructure Security
- **Review NSG rules** before deployment
- **Validate security configurations** for your environment
- **Enable monitoring** and alerting
- **Follow Azure security best practices**

## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### Before Deployment
1. ‚úÖ Review all Terraform configurations
2. ‚úÖ Understand Azure resource costs
3. ‚úÖ Set up proper authentication
4. ‚úÖ Configure backend state storage
5. ‚úÖ Test in development environment first

### During Usage
1. ‚úÖ Monitor resource costs
2. ‚úÖ Follow security best practices
3. ‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated
4. ‚úÖ Review logs and monitoring

### After Usage
1. ‚úÖ Clean up resources with `terraform destroy`
2. ‚úÖ Review final costs
3. ‚úÖ Secure any generated assets

## üìã Compliance Notice

### Framework Alignment
While this project demonstrates alignment with security frameworks (Azure Security Benchmark, CIS Controls, ISO 27001, NIST), it is:
- **For demonstration purposes only**
- **Not a compliance certification**
- **Requires professional review** for production use

### Audit Responsibility
